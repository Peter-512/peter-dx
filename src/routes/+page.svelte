		I spent the beginning of my career working in sales, where I learned how to communicate and
		put myself in the shoes of my customers.
		<br />
		In 2021, I decided to switch careers and started a bachelor in Applied Computer Science at Karel
		de Grote University College in Antwerp. During that time, I also managed to get two summer internships
		at <HoverCard
			githubAccount="datacamp"
			imageUrl={datacampLogo}
			text="build data and AI skills">
			DataCamp</HoverCard> as a Software Engineer.
		<br />
		In my free time, I like to climb and play video games.
